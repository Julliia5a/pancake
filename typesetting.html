		<h1> &#126; For the Uninitiated, a Pancake Primer</h1>
			
		<p class="main">PANCAKE batter can be made from scratch in about the same time it takes to make toast. Yet somehow, back in the “cooking-is-too-hard” ’50s, the food industry convinced most people that a mix was better and easier, despite the fact that a mix saves the cook perhaps 30 seconds.</p>

		<p class="main">The most time-consuming part of making pancakes, of course, is cooking them. But that time is so short you should consider pancakes an everyday convenience food. Unless you barely have time for cold cereal, you can make them for your children on school mornings without missing a beat.</p>

		<p class="main">You can modify them easily, too. Increasing the eggs and sugar ups the ante a bit; separate those eggs and beat the whites and you turn the ordinary pancake into something almost soufflé-like.</p>

		<p class="main">Add cottage cheese, sour cream or yogurt and you make the pancake rich and filling. Start with a small batch of polenta and you produce something very substantial.</p>
		<p class="main">Back, though, to the basic pancake, the simple batter of eggs, flour, milk and baking powder for leavening. You can switch the type of flour: whole wheat is good, a bit of buckwheat perhaps even better. You can also add fruit; I think ripe bananas are the best possible addition, though blueberries are a classic. Or if you like, incorporate peanut butter, chocolate chips or spices.</p>
		<p class="main">If you like thick pancakes, reduce the liquid; likewise add more liquid for thinner pancakes. For cakier cakes add more baking powder; for sweeter ones, more sugar.</p>
		<p class="main">Basic pancake batter can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days. You can even mix just the dry ingredients together, to store indefinitely; this, essentially, is pancake mix. The sole caveat about mixing it is this: don’t overbeat. As with just about anything containing flour (except for bread), you don’t want the gluten — the protein in the flour — to overdevelop, or the pancake will become chewy and tough.</p>
		<p class="main">An important thing to remember about the cooking part is this: you have to preheat the skillet or griddle, or the first batch will be nearly worthless.</p>
		<p class="main">Here’s a trick I learned from a box of pancake mix, circa 1960: to determine when the pan is hot enough to take the batter, heat it over medium heat until a few drops of water skid across the surface before evaporating; it’s pretty cool.</p>
		<p class="main">A well-seasoned cast iron pan will need little or no butter or oil. If you choose stainless steel or aluminum pans, use plenty of butter; the net result will be that the pancakes will taste better.</p>
		<p class="main">Nonstick pans are great for pancakes, but you may want to heed the health concerns that caution against putting an empty nonstick pan over very high heat. But that’s not necessary here, anyway.</p>
		<p class="main">When the pancake is ready to be flipped, bubbles will appear in the center. Serve immediately, if possible, with whatever toppings you like.</p>
		<p class="main">If you’re looking for maple syrup, keep in mind that Grade B is less refined and therefore more flavorful than Grade A. Also avoid so-called pancake syrup, which is just high-fructose corn syrup. Once you’ve started, you might as well stick with the real thing, no?</p>
